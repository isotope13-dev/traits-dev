# cleave Taxonomy

A three-tier taxonomy following [MBC (Malware Behavior Catalog)](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown) principles.

## Tiers

| Tier | Purpose | Criticality Range | MBC Equivalent |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Capabilities** (`micro-behaviors/`) | Observable mechanics — what code *can do* | component → baseline → notable → suspicious | [Micro-objectives](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/tree/master/micro-behaviors) |
| **Objectives** (`objectives/`) | Attacker goals — why code *likely wants* to do something | component → baseline → notable → suspicious → hostile | [Objectives](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown#malware-objective-descriptions) |
| **Known Entities** (`well-known/`) | Specific malware, unwanted software, and tool/app/library signatures | component → baseline → suspicious → hostile | [Corpus](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/tree/master/xample-malware) |
| **Metadata** (`metadata/`) | Neutral file-structure properties — what a file *is* | component → baseline (occasionally suspicious) | — |

Organize atomic traits by what they detect, not by what composite they serve — atomics and the composites that reference them often live in completely different directories. See [Matcher Defines Identity](#matcher-defines-identity) for the full rule and the placement-over-criticality guidance.

Traits rarely seen in legitimate software that have well-defined objectives belong in `objectives/` rather than `micro-behaviors/`.

## Criticality

| Level | Meaning | Tier Constraints |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **component** | Building block for composites; no standalone signal (e.g., string fragment `&cc=`). The CLI may de-emphasize or omit it unless a referencing composite fires; always present in JSON, the web UI, and differential analysis. | Any tier |
| **baseline** | Common functionality; doesn't indicate program purpose (e.g., `mmap`, `stdio`, `read`). Always present in JSON, the web UI, and differential analysis. | Any tier |
| **notable** | Defines program purpose (e.g., `socket`, `exec`, `eval`). Differential analysis surfaces appeared/disappeared traits at *every* criticality (`component` and `baseline` included), so this bar is only about which capabilities *deserve at least* `notable` — anything an analyst would want to weigh prominently in a supply-chain diff: communications (HTTP, sockets, DNS, IPC), code execution (interpreters, eval, dynamic loaders), encryption methods (AES, RSA, ChaCha, KEM), encoding/decoding methods (base64, hex, custom alphabets), privilege escalation (sudo, setuid, capabilities), file access (read/write/delete on sensitive paths), registry access (Windows registry r/w), and persistence (cron, systemd, autoruns, launch agents). | `micro-behaviors/`, `objectives/`, `well-known/` |
| **suspicious** | Rarely legitimate; indicates possible malicious intent. | `micro-behaviors/`, `objectives/`, `well-known/`, `metadata/` (rare) |
| **hostile** | Clear attack pattern; no legitimate use. Requires precision >= 3.5. | `objectives/`, `well-known/` only — **never** `micro-behaviors/` |

> **Visibility caveat — `component`/`baseline` are not hidden from users.** The CLI may de-emphasize or omit them (historically `component` was filtered unless a referencing composite fired; that is no longer guaranteed), but the JSON output, the web interface, and version-to-version differential analysis all surface them. Demoting a trait therefore does **not** make a false positive disappear — a user still sees it, mislabeled — and rules are equally important to get right at every criticality level. Lower criticality only when the lower tier is genuinely correct (a true composite fragment or universal-baseline capability). Fix a real false positive properly: tighten the matcher, add an `unless:`/`not:` exclusion, or relocate the trait (see [Matcher Defines Identity](#matcher-defines-identity)).

## ML Feature Extraction

The ML pipeline extracts features from **subdirectory path + criticality**, not individual trait IDs. Each trait's directory path (up to 3 levels deep), combined with its criticality level, becomes a feature dimension. This means:

- **Directory structure is the feature space.** A trait at `objectives/evasion/kernel-hide/rootkit/linux.yaml` with `crit: suspicious` generates the feature `evasion/kernel-hide/rootkit:suspicious`. The directory hierarchy directly shapes what the model learns.
- **Criticality is the signal strength.** Two traits in the same directory but at different criticality levels produce different features. A `suspicious` rootkit trait and a `component` rootkit trait are distinct signals.
- **Depth matters.** The pipeline uses up to 3 directory levels. Features aggregate at the deepest available level, so `evasion/kernel-hide/rootkit` is more specific than `evasion/kernel-hide`, which is more specific than `evasion`.

### Design implications for trait authors

- **Group related detections under the same subdirectory** so they aggregate into a single, strong feature. A directory with 10+ traits produces a robust signal; a directory with 1-2 traits produces a weak one.
- **Don't create single-trait subdirectories** when the trait fits an existing directory. `credential-access/browser/` (11 traits) is a strong feature; adding `credential-access/opera/` with 1 trait creates a weak feature that should instead be a file within `credential-access/browser/`.
- **Use technique-based directories.** Directory names should describe the behavior or method being detected, not the implementation language, platform, ecosystem, file type, malware family, or sample source. Put implementation details in filenames when they help readability, unless the technique itself is platform-specific.
- **Prefer concise, meaningful names.** Short directory names are easier to scan and produce cleaner ML features: use `exec`, `poll`, `proxy`, `shell`, `reflect`, or `stage` when they are clear in context. Do not shorten names so far that humans lose the technique meaning.
- **Avoid marker buckets.** Do not use `marker/` or `markers/` as directory names; name the behavior or technique being indicated instead.
- **Criticality assignment affects ML directly.** A trait bumped from `notable` to `suspicious` changes which feature it contributes to. Assign criticality based on the trait's actual detection confidence, not to manipulate features.
- **The 3-level depth limit** means `objectives/anti-static/obfuscation/string/encoding/` extracts as `anti-static/obfuscation/string` — the `encoding/` level is aggregated into `string/`. Plan directory depth accordingly, and avoid unnecessary intermediate directories (e.g., prefer `obfuscation/syntax/` over `obfuscation/source/syntax/`).

## Core Principles

### Single-Trait Rule

Unlike MBC, which allows one behavior to map to multiple objectives (e.g., Process Injection is both Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation), cleave allows exactly **one trait per behavior**. Place it at the most specific location the evidence supports. Composite rules in other directories can reference the single trait to express multi-objective interpretations.

The same logic extends to matchers: define each one once. If two traits would search for the same thing, make a single canonical atom and reference it rather than copy the pattern — duplicate matchers drift out of sync, double-count evidence, and split one signal across two ML features. Unique matchers keep the trait set slim.

### Matcher Defines Identity

**A trait's matcher is its identity. Its name, description, and directory must describe what the matcher actually searches for — not the intent of a composite that references it, and not the worst case it might contribute to.** Organize atomic traits by what they detect, not by what composite they serve. This applies at **every** criticality, `component` and `baseline` included.

A trait fails this rule when its name, description, or location claims an intent its matcher does not capture. Example: a regex that merely reads `$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']`, named `http-referer-to-reflection` ("HTTP Referer used in function execution") and filed under `objectives/command-and-control/backdoor/webshell/obf-dispatch/`. The matcher detects only *"reads the Referer request header"* — a neutral capability present in countless benign plugins — so the trait is both **mislabeled** (the name asserts reflective dispatch the regex never checks) and **misplaced** (a neutral read does not belong in a webshell objective directory). The reflective-dispatch intent lives in the *other* legs of the composite (the dynamic-call atoms); this atom only contributes "the referer was read."

**The fix is to relocate and rename the trait to match its matcher** (here, a `micro-behaviors/communications/http/...` capability such as "reads the Referer request header"), then have the webshell composite reference it cross-directory. **Lowering the criticality is never the fix.** Demoting to `component` does not make the false positive disappear — per the [Criticality](#criticality) visibility caveat, the JSON output, web UI, and differential analysis still surface it (and the CLI may too), now mislabeled as a webshell building block and keyed to the wrong `directory-path + criticality` ML feature. Reserve `component`/`baseline` for traits that are *already* accurately named and located for what they detect and genuinely have no standalone meaning.

When a generic capability false-positives because it sits in the wrong tier, fix the placement. Generic capabilities such as process execution, interpreter invocation, network clients, registry manipulation, file writes to sensitive locations, and persistence surfaces belong where those behaviors are described — usually under `micro-behaviors/` — and should stay `notable` or higher when they are analyst-relevant. Objective traits should compose those capabilities with intent-specific evidence rather than bury generic atomics as mislabeled `component` rules.

### Tier Dependencies

| Tier | Can Reference | Rationale |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| `micro-behaviors/` | `micro-behaviors/`, `metadata/`, `well-known/tool/`, `well-known/app/`, `well-known/lib/`, `well-known/game/` for false-positive exclusions only | Capabilities must not depend on objectives or malware families |
| `objectives/` | `micro-behaviors/`, `objectives/`, `metadata/`, `well-known/{tool,app,lib,game}/` (positive evidence allowed); never `well-known/malware/` | Objectives build on capabilities and other objectives. Legitimate-software identifiers are fine as positive evidence — the relationship runs `well-known/malware/ → objectives/`, not the reverse |
| `well-known/` | all tiers | Signatures can reference anything |
| `metadata/` | `metadata/`, `well-known/tool/`, `well-known/app/`, `well-known/lib/`, `well-known/game/` for benign context only | Informational properties must not depend on behavior or objectives |

**Capabilities must not reference objectives.** Capabilities are observable mechanics; objectives infer intent. If a `micro-behaviors/` rule needs an `objectives/` trait, either move the objective to `micro-behaviors/` (if it's actually a capability), refactor the dependency away, or move the whole rule to `objectives/` (if it's actually inferring intent).

**Capabilities must not use `crit: hostile`.** Hostile requires intent inference, which belongs in `objectives/`. Maximum capability criticality is `suspicious`; validation rejects hostile capabilities.

**Neutral capabilities belong in `micro-behaviors/`, not `objectives/`.** A trait that detects a single API call, syscall, or keyword (fork, crontab, SetFileAttributes, getenv) is a capability — it belongs in `micro-behaviors/` regardless of which objective composite references it. Composites reference traits across directories. Component traits (`crit: component`) may appear in `objectives/` only when they are attack-context-specific fragments with no meaning outside that context (e.g., Nemucod string pieces, default credential lists, supply-chain URL patterns).

### Directory Layout Convention

All tiers follow: `TIER/CATEGORY/BEHAVIOR/METHOD/platform.yaml`

- **`objectives/`**: `objectives/OBJECTIVE/BEHAVIOR/METHOD/` with technique-based directories and per-platform or per-ecosystem YAML files. Add sub-method directories when a method has many variants (e.g., string obfuscation techniques). Avoid platform, language, ecosystem, file-type, and family names as directories unless they are the technique being detected.
- **`micro-behaviors/`**: `micro-behaviors/CATEGORY/BEHAVIOR/METHOD/` (e.g., `crypto/symmetric/aes/ruby.yaml`, not `crypto/symmetric/aes.yaml`). If no specific method applies, group by syscall, protocol, or logical grouping. Composite traits may reference directory names to match related rules.
- **Directory names** should be short, readable, and semantically useful. Prefer `exec` over `command-execution`, `poll` over `polling-command`, and `reflect` over `reflective-loader` when the parent path supplies enough context. Keep longer names when the shorter form would be ambiguous.

### Directory & Evolution Guidelines

- **Leaf-Node Policy**: A directory level cannot contain both YAML files and subdirectories. This prevents files from being "orphaned" or miscategorized when adding new sub-techniques. If a directory contains subdirectories (representing sub-techniques), it must not contain its own YAML files.
- **Intent-Based Categorization**:
  - **`objectives/`**: Reserved for improper/malicious behavior that requires intent inference. Any finding suggesting malice or abuse must be categorized under an `objectives/` hierarchy.
  - **`micro-behaviors/`**: Reserved for strictly neutral, atomic observations. If a trait is neutral, it belongs here.
- **Platform/Language Neutrality**: Directories must NOT be named after programming languages (e.g., `python/`) or platforms (e.g., `windows/`). These are used as suffixes in YAML filenames (e.g., `dropper_python.yaml`). This ensures the ML pipeline can perform cross-language and cross-platform technique correlation.

## Decision Framework

### Tier Selection

```
Specific malware, unwanted software, or tool signature?
  → well-known/

Attacker intent inferred from capability combinations?
  → objectives/

Single observable mechanic, no intent inference?
  → micro-behaviors/
     Rarely legitimate?     → suspicious
     Defines program purpose? → notable
     Universal baseline?      → baseline

Neutral file property (not behavioral)?
  → metadata/
```

### Evasion Boundaries

Three objective categories cover evasion, following MBC's distinction between analysis evasion and detection evasion:

| Category | Target | MBC Definition | Examples |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| `anti-analysis/` | Automated analysis environments | *"Prevent, obstruct, or evade behavioral analysis — for example, analysis done using a sandbox or debugger."* (OB0001) | IsDebuggerPresent, VM detection, sandbox fingerprinting, emulator checks |
| `anti-static/` | Static analysis of the file at rest | *"Prevent or hinder static analysis. Simple static analysis identifies features such as embedded strings, header information, or file metadata. More involved static analysis involves disassembly."* (OB0002) | Code obfuscation, packing, control-flow flattening, code virtualization |
| `evasion/` | Users, admins, deployed security products | *"Enable malware to evade detection."* (OB0006) | Rootkits, masquerading, AMSI bypass, log clearing, process injection, self-deletion |

**Tiebreaker:** When a technique spans categories, ask what it *primarily* defeats:
- Fools a sandbox, debugger, emulator, or VM? → `anti-analysis/`
- Resists disassembly, decompilation, or string extraction? → `anti-static/`
- Hides from users, admins, or AV/EDR in production? → `evasion/`

### Placement Tiebreaker

When a behavior could serve multiple objectives, place the single trait where evidence points most specifically. Composites in other objectives reference it.

| Scenario | Placement | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Process injection, no further context | `evasion/process/injection/` | Stealth is the most common use; privesc/lateral composites reference it |
| Dropper (any payload delivery) | `command-and-control/dropper/` | All droppers are C2 — organized by kill-chain: delivery/, staging/, execution/, behavior/ |
| Keylogging capability detected | `collection/keylog/` | General capture; credential-access composites reference it when combined with specific store targeting |
| Rootkit hides files/processes | `evasion/kernel-hide/` | Hides from users/admins, not from sandboxes |
| Masquerades as system binary | `evasion/masquerade/` | Deceives users/admins, not analysis tools |
| Port scanning / network recon | `discovery/network/scan/` | Gaining knowledge, not propagating |
| Brute-forcing remote services (SSH, IoT) | `lateral-movement/brute-force/` | Malware brute-forcing is about spreading to new hosts |
| Local password cracking (hashcat, john) | `credential-access/` | Cracking local hashes, not spreading |
| Killing rival malware processes | `impact/degrade/` | Destructive impact, not propagation |
| WMI process execution | `execution/` | Execution; lateral only when combined with network evidence |
| Killing AV/EDR processes | `impact/degrade/edr/` | Aggression ("I'll stop you"), not stealth; evasion/anti-av/ is for bypass |
| Bypassing AMSI or using indirect syscalls | `evasion/anti-av/` | Stealth ("don't see me"), not aggressive termination |
| Disabling/flushing firewall rules | `impact/degrade/firewall/` | Degrading system capability, not hiding |
| Hidden files in system directories | `evasion/file-hiding/` | Concealment from users/admins; a hidden file doesn't survive reboots better |
| Daemon fork+setsid persisting across reboot | `persistence/system/daemon/` | Restarting after reboot is persistence |
| Reads Chrome Login Data SQLite | `credential-access/browser/` | Targets a specific credential store |
| Reads a cookie-store data field (`CookiesData`, etc.) | `micro-behaviors/communications/http/cookies/` | Neutral cookie-store field access; credential-access/exfil composites reference it |
| Extracts saved Wi-Fi profile keys | `credential-access/wifi/` | Targets a specific credential store |
| Reads `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` from env | `credential-access/env/secrets/` | Targets a specific secret |
| Reads `os.environ` generically | `micro-behaviors/os/env/` | Neutral capability, no credential targeting |
| Generic keystroke capture | `collection/keylog/` | General capture; credential-access composites reference it |
| Chrome passwords + HTTP POST to attacker | `exfiltration/stealer/credential/` | Source + transport = exfiltration |
| "admin" or "root" keyword | `micro-behaviors/data/text/keywords/` | Neutral string, not credential access |
| File property with no behavioral implication | `metadata/` | Structural fact, not behavior |
| File property indicating deceptive intent | `evasion/masquerade/` | Deception is behavioral |

## Tier 1: Capabilities (`micro-behaviors/`)

Value-neutral observations about what code can do. High confidence from static analysis. Maps to MBC [Micro-objectives](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/tree/master/micro-behaviors): *"low-level, support many objectives and other behaviors, and aren't necessarily malicious."*

│   #   particular format (pickle/marshal, an image/archive/document format)
│   #   is on the TAXONOMY notable bar — an analyst wants it surfaced in a

│   #   compress/, archive/, format/), NOT in metadata/. This includes the
│   #   neutral act of IMPORTING such a module (e.g. Python `import base64`
│   #   → encode/base64::import-base64, `import pickle` →
│   #   serialize/unsafe/python::import-pickle): the import is a capability
│   #   observation, kept at notable. metadata/ only records what a file IS
│   #   (e.g. "contains base64-looking strings"), never that code decodes.
│   #   The engine also emits a neutral per-module import node under
│   #   metadata/import/<lang>/<module> for composites that need an
│   #   import fact without inferring the decode capability.

Attacker goals inferred from capability combinations. Maps to MBC [Objectives](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown#malware-objective-descriptions). Implies *likely* intent — static analysis alone can't be 100% certain.

## Tier 3: Known Entities (`well-known/`)

Specific malware families and tool signatures. Similar to MBC's [malware corpus](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/tree/master/xample-malware) but structured as detection rules. Categories align with [MBC/STIX 2.1 malware types](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html).

Do not create general-purpose traits in `well-known/` that could match multiple families, even at a low criticality. Move general-purpose traits to a general-purpose location.

**Rules:**
- Each malware family appears in exactly **one** category — pick the primary behavior
- Categories describe **what the malware does**, not who made it or how it arrives
- Actor attribution (APT group, nation-state) belongs in trait descriptions, not directory names
- When a family has multiple capabilities (e.g., stealer + worm), pick the most distinctive
- `trojan/` is the catch-all — use only when no more specific type fits

## Metadata (`metadata/`)

File-level properties with no behavioral implication. Describes *what a file is*, not *what it does*.

**Rules:**
- Behavioral detection belongs in `objectives/`, not here
- Tool/malware signatures belong in `well-known/`, not here
- Supply-chain attack indicators belong in `objectives/supply-chain/` (organized by technique, not ecosystem)
- OS/platform vendor traits go under `vendor/`
- Specific apps, tools, games, and library/framework/runtime fingerprints go under `well-known/{app,tool,game,lib}/`, not `metadata/`
- New top-level subdirectories require updating both TAXONOMY.md and `ALLOWED_METADATA` in `src/capabilities/validation/directory_whitelist.rs`
- **Max depth:** 3 levels within `metadata/` (ML pipeline limit)
- **Max leaf size:** No leaf directory should exceed 80 traits
- **Prefer technology-neutral subdirectory names.** Technology names belong in filenames, not directory names, unless needed to stay under the 80-trait limit at depth 3.

### Metadata boundary rubric

When placing a new metadata trait, use this tiebreaker table. Each row names the two most likely categories and the deciding question:

| Category A | Category B | Deciding question |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `binary/` | `file/` | Does it require parsing binary headers (PE/ELF/Mach-O)? → `binary/`. Observable from filename/magic/size alone? → `file/` |
| `binary/` | `document/` | Does it require a binary parser? → `binary/`. Does it require a document parser (OLE, OOXML, PDF objects)? → `document/` |
| `binary/` | `lang/` | Is it about the binary's structure (sections, imports, metrics)? → `binary/`. Is it about what language/compiler produced it? → `lang/` |
| `binary/metrics/` | `binary/anomaly/` | Is the measurement neutral (could be normal)? → `metrics/`. Does it inherently indicate malformation or tampering? → `anomaly/` |
| `document/` | `file/` | Does it require parsing document internals (OLE streams, OOXML parts, PDF objects)? → `document/`. Observable from header/extension alone? → `file/` |
| `build/` | `lang/` | Is it about build orchestration (cmake, docker, CI/CD)? → `build/`. Is it about the language toolchain (gcc, rustc, delphi)? → `lang/` |
| `package/` | `library/` | Is it about ecosystem-level metadata (fields, scripts, quality, testing)? → `package/`. Is it neutral library context retained for metadata use? → `library/`. Is it identifying a specific library/framework/runtime? → `well-known/lib/` |
| `signed/` | `vendor/` | Is it about the cryptographic signature chain or entitlements? → `signed/`. Is it identifying an OS/platform vendor by strings/resources/patterns? → `vendor/` |
| `vendor/` | `well-known/app/` or `well-known/tool/` | Is it an OS/platform vendor or system userland marker (Apple, Microsoft, NetBSD, GNU/FSF)? → `vendor/`. Is it a specific application or suite? → `well-known/app/`. Is it a utility or analyst/admin/developer tool? → `well-known/tool/` |
| `vendor/` | `well-known/lib/` | Is it identifying the platform vendor that produced the file? → `vendor/`. Is it an embedded third-party library/framework/runtime fingerprint (OpenSSL, zlib, FFmpeg, psutil, SharpShell)? → `well-known/lib/` |

## Reference

### Trait ID Format

```
directory/path::trait-name
└─────┬──────┘  └────┬────┘
  directory      local ID
```

**Reference patterns:**
- `trait-name` — same directory (local)
- `micro-behaviors/communications/http` — any trait in directory
- `micro-behaviors/communications/http::curl-download` — exact match

### Composite Rules

Capabilities combine into objectives via composite rules:

```yaml
# objectives/command-and-control/reverse-shell/combos.yaml
composite_rules:
  - id: reverse-shell
    desc: "Reverse shell pattern"
    crit: hostile
    all:
      - id: micro-behaviors/communications/socket/create
      - id: micro-behaviors/process/fd/dup
      - id: micro-behaviors/process/create/shell
```

### Example Classifications

| Code Pattern | Tier | Path | Criticality |
|--------------|------|------|-------------|
| `socket()` call | Capability | `micro-behaviors/communications/socket/create` | notable |
| `eval()` call | Capability | `micro-behaviors/process/create/eval/dynamic` | notable |
| Process hollowing | Capability | `micro-behaviors/process/hollow` | suspicious |
| Screenshot API | Capability | `micro-behaviors/hardware/display/screenshot` | notable |
| Screenshot + timer + upload | Objective | `objectives/collection/screenshot` | suspicious |
| Reverse shell pattern | Objective | `objectives/command-and-control/reverse-shell` | hostile |
| Cobalt Strike beacon | Known | `well-known/malware/rat/cobalt-strike` | hostile |

### MBC Identifiers

- **ATT&CK Techniques**: `T1234` or `T1234.001` (sub-technique)
- **MBC Behaviors**: `B0001` (behavior), `C0015` (micro-behavior)
- **MBC Enhanced**: `E1234` (ATT&CK technique with MBC enhancements)
